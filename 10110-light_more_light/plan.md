# Problem
- Florida man, goes by, 'Mabu', has a screw or two lose, not that he is to blame. All things considered, its 2022. His brain forces him to toggle a series of lights on and off depending on the number of times he passes through a corridor of lights, toggling the lights that are divisible by the number of his current walking cycle, or else.. lets hope we don't find out. Task is simple, if the final light is on we say Yay, otherwise Nay.
